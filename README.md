- time-based gameplay,
- audio/musical interaction,
- front-end game architecture (state management, UI updates, asset pipeline),
- collaboration workflow (splitting tasks, integrating features, and iteration).

## Technical Highlights

- **Web-based game loop** with time-based updates
- **Input handling** designed for responsive interactions
- **Audio/MIDI-oriented asset usage** (for musical structure and timing content)
- Clear separation of concerns:
  - assets (images/fonts/midi),
  - presentation (CSS),
  - gameplay logic (JS)
